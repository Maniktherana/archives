## Part 1

### Description-1

Using the [Github Api](https://docs.github.com/en/rest), show all the issues of the [PHP-FFMpeg](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg) repository in a table and filter the results with the word passed in a textbox. Use React to create the project. No database is required here.

For this submission I utilized [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for quick builds, React for the frontend, and [MantineUI](https://mantine.dev/pages/getting-started/) for the styling. I also used the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) library to handle the API calls.
